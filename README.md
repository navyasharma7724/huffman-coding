# huffman-coding

This project employs the Huffman coding algorithm ( renowned data compression technique invented by David Huffman) along with queue and binary tree implementations to build a Huffman tree and encode and decode encrypted messages. All files except HuffmanCoding.java were pre-written and imported from https://ds.cs.rutgers.edu/assignment-huffman-coding/. To test this project, run the Driver.java file.
